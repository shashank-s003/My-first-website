    <h1><b>RATE EQUATION <br></b></h1>
    <p>In chemistry the rate equation(also known as the rate law or the empirical differential rate equation) is an empirical <br>
    differential mathematical expression for the reaction rate of the given reaction in trms ofconcentration of chemical <br>
    species and constant parameters (normally rate coefficient and partial orders of reaction) only. For many reactions, the <br>
    initial rate is given by a power law such as <br>
        v <sub>0</sub> = k[A] <sup>x</sup> [y] <sup>y</sup> <br>
    where [A] and [B] are the molar concentrations of the species A and B, usually in moles per litre (Molarity M).
